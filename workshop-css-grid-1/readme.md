## Slide 2: Introduction to Grid

- **What is CSS Grid?**
  - A two-dimensional layout system for the web.
  - Allows for flexible placement of items in rows and columns.
  - Makes complex layouts easier to manage than with traditional methods.
- **Why Use Grid?**
  - Simplify complex layouts
  - Create responsive designs with ease
  - Improve website performance
  - Enhance accessibility

## Slide 3: Key Grid Terminology

- **Grid Container:** The parent element that holds the grid items.
- **Grid Item:** The child elements that are positioned within the grid.
- **Grid Lines:** The horizontal and vertical lines that divide the grid.
- **Grid Tracks:** The space between two grid lines (a row or a column).
- **Grid Cell:** The smallest unit of the grid, formed by the intersection of two grid lines.
- **Grid Area:** A rectangular area made up of one or more grid cells.

## Slide 4: Creating a Grid Container

```css
.container {
  display: grid; /* or inline-grid */
}
```

- Use the `display: grid` property on the parent element to create a grid container.
- Direct children of the container automatically become grid items.

## Slide 5: Defining Rows and Columns (Explicit Grid)

```css
.container {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; /* Three columns */
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px; /* Two rows */
}
```

- Use `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` to explicitly define grid tracks.
- Various units can be used: `px`, `fr` (fractional unit), `%`, `em`, `auto`, etc.

## Slide 6: Placing Grid Items (Line-Based Placement)

```css
.item1 {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: 3;
  grid-row-start: 1;
  grid-row-end: 2;
}
```

- Use `grid-column-start/end` and `grid-row-start/end` to position items by specifying the grid lines they occupy.

## Slide 7: Grid Gap and Alignment

```css
.container {
  grid-gap: 20px; /* or grid-column-gap, grid-row-gap */
  justify-items: center; /* Horizontal alignment */
  align-items: center; /* Vertical alignment */
}
```

- Control spacing with `grid-gap` (or separate column and row gaps).
- Align items within their grid cells using `justify-items` and `align-items`.

## Slide 8: Implicit Grid and Auto-Placement

- If items are placed outside the defined explicit grid, the grid will automatically create new tracks (implicit grid).
- Use `grid-auto-flow` to control the direction of auto-placement (row or column).

## Slide 9: Advanced Grid Features (Brief Overview)

- **Named Grid Areas:** Assign names to grid areas for easier placement.
- **Grid Template Areas:** Visually define grid areas using ASCII art-like syntax.
- **Repeating Patterns:** Use `repeat()` for repetitive track definitions.
- **Min/Max Sizing:** Control minimum and maximum track sizes.
- **Auto-Fit/Auto-Fill:** Dynamically fit columns into a container.
